    "## Lesson 5.1: Importing Modules\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Importing and Using Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the `math` module and use it to calculate the square root of 25 and the sine of 90 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Aliasing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the `datetime` module with an alias and use it to print the current date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Importing Specific Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the `randint` function from the `random` module and use it to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Importing Multiple Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the `sqrt` and `pow` functions from the `math` module and use them to calculate the square root of 16 and 2 raised to the power of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Handling Import Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that attempts to import a non-existent module and gracefully handles the import error by printing an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson 5.2: Standard Library Overview\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Working with the `os` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `os` module to create a new directory, list the contents of the current directory, and remove the newly created directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Working with the `sys` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `sys` module to print the Python version currently in use and the command-line arguments passed to the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Working with the `math` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Working with the `datetime` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `datetime` module to print the current date, calculate the date 100 days from today, and determine the day of the week for a given date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Working with the `random` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `random` module to generate a list of 5 random numbers between 1 and 50 and shuffle the elements of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson 5.3: Creating and Using Packages\n",
    "### Assignment 11: Creating a Simple Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a package named `mypackage` with two modules: `module1` and `module2`. `module1` should contain a function that adds two numbers, and `module2` should contain a function that multiplies two numbers. Write code to use these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Using `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `mypackage` package to include an `__init__.py` file that imports the functions from `module1` and `module2`. Write code to use these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Importing from a Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to import and use the functions from `mypackage` without explicitly importing `module1` and `module2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Relative Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a subpackage named `subpackage` within `mypackage` and move `module2` into `subpackage`. Modify the import statements in `__init__.py` to use relative imports. Write code to use the functions from both modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Handling Package Import Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that attempts to import a non-existent function from `mypackage` and gracefully handles the import error by printing an error message."
